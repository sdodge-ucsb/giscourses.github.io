## Course Description
We use Geographic information (GI) in locational questions in everyday life (e.g. when you get an Uber) and to investigate spatial problems. This course aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the principles of Geographic Information Systems and Science.  Topics span the nature of geographic information and the procedures for operating GIS. The purpose of this course is threefold: **First**, it will give students an understanding of what GIS and GIScience are more broadly. **Second**, it will equip students with skills and hands-on training to generate, edit, handle, represent, and analyze spatial data using common GIS packages. **Third**, it will familiarize students with applications of GIS in solving basic geographic, social, and environmental problems. Labs provide hands-on experience with [Esri ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview).

>_This is a 4-unit course, with Geog w12 as a recommended prerequisite._

## Learning Outcomes
If you participate fully and complete the course, by the end, you should be able to
- describe underlying concepts and technologies involved in GIS and GIScience.
- identify, discuss, and use different spatial data models and apply spatial analysis
- identify, discuss, and develop solutions to basic spatial problems.
- locate, gather, prepare, edit, map, and analyze geospatial data.
- work with standard GIS packages such as ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Online
- appreciate and describe the board applications of GIScience.
